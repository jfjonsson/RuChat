### 5 Authentication
>Where are the passwords stored? 

We decided to store the passwords encoded in a haspmap where each encrypted password is mapped to a username. This ensures that all usernames are unique and the time it takes to match a login attempt is minimal.

>Where are the salt strings stored?

Steinn

>Why do you send the plain text password/hashed password? 

We decided to send the password as plain text from the client to the server.

>What are the security implications of your decision?



### 6 Private messages
>Should private messages be logged? 

No private messages should not be logged in our system. Because we have not implemented a way to retrieve them back and there fore we would be saving data we are not using. The messages could contain sensative information and since we have no safe way of storing the messages we decide not to store any message sent to the server.

>If so, what should be logged about private messages? 

We log who sent the message and to whom or what room and at what time. No detaild information other than the user information and what action he is taking  is logged.

>What are the consequences of your decisions?

We do not get access to the full history of what has been said on the server and cannot use the data for any analysis. However we gain some trust from our users in the sence that they know what they say will not end up in the wrong hands.
